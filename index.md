Highly independent, curious, eager to learn and always looking to push boundaries. Puck is in the middle of her PhD in building physics-based machine-learning models to predict properties of molecules and chemical reactions. She also loves sports, right now climbing in particular. She is proud to be a woman in science and technology.
