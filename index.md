Highly independent, curious, eager to learn and always looking to push boundaries. Puck is in the final year of her PhD in building machine-learning models to predict properties of molecules and chemical reactions. When she's not writing code, she can usually be found on a climbing wall. She is looking for opportunities as a machine learning researcher (academic or industry) at the interface between machine learning and molecules.
