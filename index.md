Highly independent, curious, eager to learn and always looking to push boundaries. Puck is in the final year of her PhD in building physics-based machine-learning models to predict properties of molecules and chemical reactions. She can be found at the Microsoft Research office in Amsterdam between 1st October - 24th December this year. When she's not writing code, she can usually be found on a climbing wall. She is proud to be a woman in science and technology.
